# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code


----------------------------------------------WORK DAY SCHEDULER------------------------------------------

I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
I open the planner
The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
I scroll down
I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
I view the timeblocks for that day
Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
I click into a timeblock
I can enter an event
I click the save button for that timeblock
The text for that event is saved in local storage
I refresh the page
The saved events persist
